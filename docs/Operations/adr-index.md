# ADR Index

List of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). If no ADRs exist yet, this file seeds the structure.

## Planned / To Consider
- Introduce circuit breaker middleware for outbound API
- Evaluate migration path from Vue 2 to a modern frontend stack (long term)
- Adopt structured metrics naming standard
